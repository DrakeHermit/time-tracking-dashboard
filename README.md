## My process

1. Wrote the HTML markup (which got updated along the way)
2. Wrote the CSS (mobile version)
3. Wrote the CSS (desktop version)
4. Started writing JS code 
  - 1. Wrote the code to highlight daily, weekly, or monthly timeframes
  - 2. Fetched the JSON data asynchronously
  - 3. Filtered the data based on which button was clicked
  - 4. Updated the DOM with the given data

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned a ton working on this challenge, but my main focus with this challenge was to understand how fetching and filtering works, and then how updating the DOM works. I managed to do most of the work myself but of course I had to google how to do stuff without asking what I specifically need to do.

### Continued development

I will keep on working on my frontend dev skills as I go along completing the challenges in the learning paths. But I truly am surprised at myself as to how concepts are starting to click for me. But I am glad that I learned how to retrieve the data from JSON which is basically how an API sends and receives info.
